In response to the global COVID-19 pandemic and the widespread adoption of face masks, the Face Mask Detection Project aims to utilize deep learning to detect faces with and without masks. The model is trained on a dataset containing 7553 RGB images, categorized into two folders: "with_mask" and "without_mask."

## Dataset


The dataset comprises 7553 RGB images, with each image belonging to one of two classes: "with_mask" or "without_mask." The images are labeled according to their respective classes, making it easy to distinguish between faces with masks and faces without masks.

- **Total Images:** 7553
- **Images with Mask:** 3725
- **Images without Mask:** 3828

The custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture used for training the model achieved impressive results:

- **Training Accuracy:** 94%
- **Validation Accuracy:** 96%
